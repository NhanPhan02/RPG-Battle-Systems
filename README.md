# RPG-Battle-Systems
My 2 crowning achievements from high school.

Uncompiled copies of 2 RPG battle systems I made in Java.
Code is a reminder of where I started.

Simple battle system was based off of Pokemon with a Darkest Dungeon theme. (cringe inducing)

FGO battle system was based off of... well... FGO. (also cringe inducing)
